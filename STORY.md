**52 horses died at Belmont last year but where's the outcry?**

In 2019, the horse racing industry faced its moment of reckoning. Thirty horses died in a six-month stretch at the Santa Anita Park in California, and the story made headlines around the country.  The media's interest was piqued, the public was concerned, the activists were fired up, and there was even talk of a petition that could prompt a ballot initiative in California on whether horse racing should discontinue. 

But that moment of reckoning was fleeting, partly due to the pandemic and partly due to a lack of public awareness about the dirty underbelly of horse racing.

In March 2020, over two dozen trainers, veterinarians and drug distributors were charged in a series of federal indictments for participating in a racehorse doping scheme. Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said they found that horses were “injected and force-fed all manner of illegal and experimental drugs, drugs that allowed the horses to run unnaturally fast and to mask pain," which could result in injury and death. 

No one could conclusively figure out the reason for the spate of equine deaths that occurred at Santa Anita, but the findings of the federal investigation might have offered some insight. Especially with horses dying again in large numbers, this time at Belmont Park.

Belmont is the home of the Belmont Stakes — traditionally the third leg of the prestigious Triple Crown, after the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes — and also the location where 52 horses have died last year. Yet, there was hardly a peep about it.

One of the reasons is the flawed Equine Injury Database. Most publications refer to its data to draw a conclusion about where equine deaths are occuring at an alarming rate, but its numbers tell only bits and pieces of a much larger story. The EID provides the rate of deaths in terms 1000 starts — the amount of times a horse steps on the track — and defines deaths as only those that occur within 72 hours of racing. Notably, that does not include deaths that occur in training and timed workouts.

That means the EID only counted six deaths at Belmont in 2020 though the data from ny.gov.data reported 52 deaths. The number of deaths in the past five years at Belmont are shown to be declining, according to the EID, but the reality is that the numbers are actually increasing. 

It is impossible to say what the reason for this is, but questions could be directed at some trainers who have overseen several horses that have been injured or have died, year after year. Rodolfo (Rudy) Rodriguez was the trainer in charge for 13 horses that were hurt over the past five years, including six that have died. Meanwhile, Jeremiah C Englehart and Gary C Contessa trained seven horses that died during that time span, though their overall numbers were lower.

The horse racing industry needs to be scrutinized further and though the Justice Department have said they will continue to investigate, the media needs to do a better job in seeking out the facts.
