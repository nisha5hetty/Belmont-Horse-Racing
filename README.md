 Project 3

**Finding Data:**

**Equine Death and Breakdown**
Source: data.ny.gov
New York provides data of the all horses that have died or been injured at race tracks across the state. I filtered to include only the stats for Belmont Park and downloaded a spreadsheet covering the numbers for 2016 to 2020. I also filtered by trainers for the same years.

**Equine Injury Database**
Source: The Jockey Club
The national database provides fatality rates at races tracks across the country but with an important caveat: It only counts horses that died within 72 hours of racing. I copy-pasted the fatality rates at Belmont Park across 2016 to 2020 to make a new table.

**Visualizations:**

1. I wanted to chart the rate of equine deaths in Belmont Park from 2016 to 2020. I used pandas to figure out the number of deaths in each year and then created a new table of those figures. I wanted to chart the fatality rates at Belmont Park using the table I created with the data from the Equine Injury Database. I used Datawrapper to combine the two and made a bar graph.

3. I wanted to make a table of the top five trainers who were involved in the most number of equine deaths and breakdowns over the past five years. I usedÂ panda to figure this out and then I created a table in Datawrapper

**Limitations:**

I feel somewhat limited by Datawrapper. I decided to stick with simple graphics this time because the graphics I would like to use involve programs that I don't know how to use at this moment.

**Summary of my analysis:**

At first, I was confused by the different numbers of equine deaths reported by the Equine Injury Database and by ny.gov.data. Most major publications which covered the Santa Anita Park story never explained how the data was collected by EID, they just reported the numbers. Even now, publications still cover stories about horse racing using the EID's data as a foundation for their analysis. But that only offers a glimpse of the real story.

I had also read a lot about how the network of people that administer illegal drugs to horses and thought it might be insightful to find out whether any trainer at Belmont was involved with a significant number of horses that had injuries or died over the past five years. It's hard to say what the numbers exactly mean, but I think someone investigating the story should definitely question their methods.
